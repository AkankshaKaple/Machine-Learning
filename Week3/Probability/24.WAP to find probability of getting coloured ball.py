Imagine that you have three urns that you cannot see into.
Urn1 is 90%  green balls	and	10% red. Urn2	is 50%	green and 50% blue. Urn3 is	20% green, 40% red,	and	40%	blue.
You	canâ€™t tell which urn is	which. You	randomly select	an	urn	and	 then randomly	select	a ball	from it.
The	ball you drew is	green.	What is	the	 probability that	it	came	from	urn1?
